# Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. "Input mapper not available" Error ✅
**Problem**: Cards were initialized before Main scene completed its `_Ready()` method, so input mapper wasn't available.

**Solution**:
- Moved input system initialization to AFTER hand setup in Main.cs
- Added `NotifyCardsInputSystemReady()` method to find and notify existing cards
- Added `NotifyInputSystemReady()` method to Card.cs for late initialization
- Cards now get their input handlers after the system is fully initialized

### 2. Enter Key Not Working ✅
**Problem**: New KeyboardInputHandler was conflicting with existing GameInputManager, and trying to execute commands that didn't integrate with existing game flow.

**Solution**:
- Updated InputToCommandMapper to integrate with existing event system instead of bypassing it
- Enter key now calls: `gameStateManager.TriggerEvent(GameStateEvent.StartGame)`
- Space key now publishes: `PlayCardsRequestedEvent`
- Delete key now publishes: `DiscardCardsRequestedEvent`
- Added proper using statements for Maximagus.Scripts.Events

### 3. System Integration ✅
**Fixed Integration Flow**:
```
User Input → New InputHandler → Existing Event System → Existing Game Logic
```

Instead of:
```
User Input → New InputHandler → New Commands → Bypass Existing System ❌
```

## Technical Changes Made:

### Main.cs:
- Moved `InitializeNewInputSystem()` after `_handManager.SetupHandNode()`
- Added `NotifyCardsInputSystemReady()` method
- Added recursive card finding logic

### Card.cs:
- Added `NotifyInputSystemReady(InputToCommandMapper)` method
- Cards can now initialize input handlers after system is ready

### InputToCommandMapper.cs:
- Added integration with existing GameStateManager and EventBus
- Enter/Space/Delete keys now work through existing event system
- Added `using Maximagus.Scripts.Events;`

## Result:
- ✅ Cards should now initialize input handlers properly (no more "input mapper not available")
- ✅ Enter key should now work for starting the game
- ✅ Space key should work for playing cards
- ✅ Delete key should work for discarding cards
- ✅ New system integrates with existing game logic instead of bypassing it
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Test Instructions:
1. Run the game
2. Check console - should see "Card input handler initialized for card X via notification" messages
3. Press Enter - should start/advance the game
4. Select cards and press Space - should play the selected cards
5. Select cards and press Delete - should discard the selected cards

The new input system now works alongside the existing system rather than replacing it!
