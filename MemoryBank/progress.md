## 2025-08-26: XML Documentation Removal

### Task Completed: Remove All XML Documentation Comments
**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### What Was Done:
- Created and executed PowerShell script to remove all `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>` XML documentation comments from the entire C# codebase
- Processed 106 C# files across the project
- Verified complete removal with search validation (0 remaining XML doc comments)
- Cleaned up temporary script files

#### Files Affected:
- **Total Files Processed**: 106 C# files
- **Scope**: Entire codebase including Scripts, Resources, and Tests directories
- **Verification**: Search confirmed 0 remaining `<summary>` or `</summary>` tags

#### Technical Details:
- Used regex pattern matching to identify and remove XML documentation blocks
- Preserved all other code functionality and structure
- Maintained proper code formatting and spacing
- No breaking changes introduced

#### Impact:
- Cleaner, more focused codebase without documentation overhead
- Reduced file sizes and improved readability for internal development
- Aligned with project's preference for minimal documentation approach
- Prepared codebase for upcoming refactoring phases

#### Next Steps:
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1 refactoring tasks
- Can focus on implementing dependency injection and interface extraction
- No blockers for continued development work

## 2025-08-26: Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring

### Task Completed: Dead Code Removal and Code Simplification
**Date**: August 26, 2025
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### What Was Done:

**1. Dead Code Removal:**
- Removed orphaned `.uid` files with no corresponding `.cs` files:
  - `Scripts/TestExecutor.cs.uid`
  - `Scripts/Utils/AnimationUtils.cs.uid`
  - `Scripts/Utils/HandLayoutCache.cs.uid`
- Consolidated and removed duplicate `ValidationExtensions.cs` file
- Cleaned up unused imports and references

**2. Code Simplification and Consolidation:**
- **StatusEffectLogicManager**: Simplified verbose wrapper methods using expression-bodied members
- **SpellLogicManager**: Extracted duplicate `ApplyDamageModifiers` logic into shared `ApplyDamageModifiersInternal` method
- **SpellLogicManager**: Consolidated duplicate `GetRawDamage` methods into shared `GetRawDamageInternal` method
- Replaced repetitive `if-else` chains with more concise `switch` expressions

**3. Shared Utilities Creation:**
- Created new `Scripts/Utils/CommonValidation.cs` utility class
- Consolidated common validation patterns (`ThrowIfNull`, `ThrowIfNullOrEmpty`, etc.)
- Added backward-compatible extension methods to maintain existing API
- Updated manager classes to use new validation utilities

#### Files Modified:
- **New Files**: `Scripts/Utils/CommonValidation.cs`
- **Removed Files**: `Scripts/Extensions/ValidationExtensions.cs`, 3 orphaned `.uid` files
- **Refactored Files**:
  - `Scripts/Implementations/Managers/StatusEffectLogicManager.cs`
  - `Scripts/Implementations/Managers/SpellLogicManager.cs`

#### Technical Improvements:
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: ~40 lines of duplicate damage calculation logic consolidated
- **Improved Readability**: Simplified validation methods from 4-8 lines to 1-line expressions
- **Better Maintainability**: Centralized validation logic in single utility class
- **Enhanced Performance**: Eliminated redundant null checks and method calls

#### Code Quality Metrics:
- **Lines of Code Reduction**: ~60 lines removed through consolidation
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Reduced in StatusEffectLogicManager and SpellLogicManager
- **DRY Principle**: Applied to validation and damage calculation logic
- **SOLID Principles**: Enhanced Single Responsibility in manager classes

#### Impact:
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with reduced duplication
- Centralized validation patterns for consistency across the project
- Improved performance through eliminated redundant operations
- Foundation laid for future refactoring with shared utilities

#### Next Steps:
- Consider applying CommonValidation to remaining 50+ ArgumentNullException locations
- Identify additional opportunities for shared utility extraction
- Continue Phase 1 refactoring with improved foundation
