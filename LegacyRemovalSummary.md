# Legacy System Removal - Pure Command Architecture

## 🚫 LEGACY SYSTEMS COMPLETELY REMOVED

### **Disabled in ServiceLocator.cs:**
```csharp
// RegisterService<IHandManager, HandManager>(); // DISABLED - using new command system  
// RegisterService<IGameStateManager, GameStateManager>(); // DISABLED - using new command system
// RegisterService<GameInputManager>(false); // DISABLED - using new input system
```

### **Main.cs - Removed Legacy References:**
- ❌ Removed `IGameStateManager _gameStateManager`
- ❌ Removed `IHandManager _handManager` 
- ❌ Removed `_gameStateManager.StartGame()`
- ❌ Removed `_handManager.SetupHandNode()`
- ✅ Added direct `Hand _hand` reference
- ✅ Renamed to `InitializeNewCommandSystem()`

### **InputToCommandMapper.cs - Pure Command Mode:**
- ❌ Removed `using Maximagus.Scripts.Events`
- ❌ Removed `eventBus?.Publish(new PlayCardsRequestedEvent())`
- ❌ Removed `eventBus2?.Publish(new DiscardCardsRequestedEvent())`
- ❌ Removed `gameStateManager?.TriggerEvent(GameStateEvent.StartGame)`
- ✅ Now returns **actual commands**: `new PlayHandCommand()`, `new DiscardHandCommand()`

## 🎯 PURE COMMAND FLOW ACTIVE

### **New Architecture (No Legacy Fallbacks):**
```
User Input → InputHandler → InputToCommandMapper → IGameCommand → GameCommandProcessor → GameState
```

### **What Should Now Execute:**
1. **Space Key**: `PlayHandCommand.Execute()` should be called
2. **Delete Key**: `DiscardHandCommand.Execute()` should be called  
3. **Card Clicks**: `SelectCardCommand.Execute()` / `DeselectCardCommand.Execute()` should be called
4. **Drag Operations**: `ReorderCardsCommand.Execute()` should be called

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ❌ **NO** legacy HandManager event processing
- ❌ **NO** legacy GameStateManager transitions  
- ❌ **NO** EventBus publications for Play/Discard
- ✅ **ONLY** new command system executions
- ✅ Commands should modify GameState directly
- ✅ Command history should track all actions

## 🧪 TESTING THE PURE SYSTEM

### **Add Logging to Verify:**
Add these logs to test if commands are executing:

**In PlayHandCommand.Execute():**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("[PlayHandCommand] Execute() called!");
```

**In DiscardHandCommand.Execute():**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("[DiscardHandCommand] Execute() called!");
```

**In SelectCardCommand.Execute():**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("[SelectCardCommand] Execute() called!");
```

### **Expected Results:**
- When you press **Space**: Should see `[PlayHandCommand] Execute() called!`
- When you press **Delete**: Should see `[DiscardHandCommand] Execute() called!`
- When you click **Card**: Should see `[SelectCardCommand] Execute() called!`

### **If Commands Are NOT Executing:**
The issue could be:
1. InputToCommandMapper is not receiving input events
2. Commands are being created but not executed by GameCommandProcessor
3. Input handlers are not properly initialized

## 🚀 SYSTEM STATUS

✅ **Legacy Systems**: Completely disabled (HandManager, GameStateManager, GameInputManager)
✅ **Pure Command Architecture**: Active
✅ **Build Success**: All code compiles
🔍 **Ready for Testing**: Commands should now execute instead of legacy event handling

**This is now a pure command-driven system with zero legacy fallbacks!**
