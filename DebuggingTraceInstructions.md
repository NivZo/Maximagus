# Debugging Trace Instructions - Find the Input System Issue

## üîç Added Comprehensive Logging

I've added debugging at every level to trace the entire input flow:

### **KeyboardInputHandler.cs** - First Level
When you press ANY key, you should see:
```
[KeyboardInputHandler] _UnhandledInput called
[KeyboardInputHandler] Processing key: Enter (or Space, Delete, etc.)
[KeyboardInputHandler] Command processed: true/false
```

**If you DON'T see this** ‚Üí The KeyboardInputHandler isn't receiving input at all

### **InputToCommandMapper.cs** - Second Level  
Already has logging from before:
```
[InputMapper] Successfully processed KeyPress: Start Game
```

### **StartGameCommand.cs** - Third Level
When Enter is pressed, you should see:
```
[StartGameCommand] Execute() called!
[StartGameCommand] Current phase: Menu
[StartGameCommand] Next phase: GameStart
[StartGameCommand] Execute() completed - new phase: GameStart
```

## üß™ Test Sequence:

### **Step 1: Run the game and press Enter**
Look for this exact sequence:
1. `[KeyboardInputHandler] _UnhandledInput called`
2. `[KeyboardInputHandler] Processing key: Enter`  
3. `[InputMapper] Successfully processed KeyPress: Start Game`
4. `[StartGameCommand] Execute() called!`
5. `[StartGameCommand] Current phase: Menu`
6. `[StartGameCommand] Next phase: GameStart`
7. `[StartGameCommand] Execute() completed - new phase: GameStart`

### **Step 2: Identify Where It Breaks**

**Scenario A**: No KeyboardInputHandler messages
- **Problem**: KeyboardInputHandler not initialized or not receiving input
- **Fix**: Check Main.cs initialization

**Scenario B**: KeyboardInputHandler messages but no InputMapper messages  
- **Problem**: InputToCommandMapper not receiving or processing input
- **Fix**: Check ProcessInput method

**Scenario C**: InputMapper messages but no StartGameCommand messages
- **Problem**: Command not being executed by GameCommandProcessor
- **Fix**: Check GameCommandProcessor.ExecuteCommand()

**Scenario D**: StartGameCommand messages but no visible effect
- **Problem**: GameState changes aren't reflected in UI
- **Fix**: Check how GameState connects to UI

## üéØ Expected Output:
When you press Enter, you should see a flood of console messages tracing the entire flow from keyboard input to command execution.

**Test it now and tell me which messages you see (or don't see)!**

This will pinpoint exactly where the system is failing.
